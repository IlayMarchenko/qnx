 *
 *  @brief Dictionary Object API
 *
 *  A dictionary object is a collection of key-value pairs. Each pair is
 *  considered an entry or a 'named value', where the key acts as the name of
 *  the entry. Keys are unique - you can't add an entry with a duplicate key.
 *
 *  Both the keys and values are represented by shareable string objects. A
 *  shareable string is a data structure that encapsulates a string so that it
 *  can't be modified directly. This design allows multiple threads to read the
 *  string without the risk that the string will be changed inadvertently
 *  between reads. Modifying a shareable string creates a new string and
 *  destroys the original.
 *
 *  The dictionary object API allows the creation of multiple handles to a
 *  dictionary object that can be used and destroyed by independent components
 *  of a program. Since a dictionary, once created, is immutable until
 *  destroyed, components can access it through their handles without worrying
 *  about synchronization.
 *
 *  Different dictionary object handles may be represented by identical
 *  pointers. You should not compare handles. Regardless of how the handles are
 *  represented internally, you must destroy each handle separately to properly
 *  dispose of any resources associated with it.
 *
