You will not, and will not assist, permit or enable any other party to:\n\n(a) \tdecompile, disassemble, decrypt, extract, unbundle, translate, or otherwise attempt or assist others to reverse engineer any part of the Software except as permitted by an open source license applying to a specific part of the Software, or except to the extent that QSS is expressly precluded by law from prohibiting these activities. Except for published Source Code files that are expressly identified by QSS as open source software, the Software IS NOT OPEN SOURCE. To the extent permitted by applicable open source license(s), any Notice File or other references identifying applicable open source license terms for the Software apply only to the original open source code used by or for QSS or its licensors and not to any pre-existing code modified using or combined with such open source code, or any new interests in derivative works created from such open source code;\n\n(b)\talter, remove, or cover any trademark, logo, proprietary or licensing notices, labels, or marks in or on any part of the Software. You agree to exercise reasonable efforts to ensure that all whole or partial copies of the Software bear the same notices, labels, and marks contained in or on the original Software;\n\n(c) \tallow shared use of: \n\n(i) \tSoftware on named user Development Seats, \n\n(ii) \tDevelopment License Certificates, License Keys, Floating Licenses (except as expressly allowed in Section 3(a)), Project Licenses (except as expressly allowed), or \n\n(iii) \tSupport services or entitlements, including but not limited to sharing Updates with developers who are using Development Seats for which the required Support fees have not been paid, or updating Target Systems;\n\n(d)\tdisclose or distribute to any other party Development License Certificates, License Keys (except as expressly permitted) or myQNX.com account passwords, use unauthorized Development License Certificates, or circumvent the key activation or key management mechanisms contained in the Software, the QNX Software Center, or at the myQNX.com site. You agree to treat the Development License Certificates and all associated License Keys and passwords as QSS Confidential Information pursuant to Section 13 (Confidential Information); \n\n(e) \tdirectly or indirectly export, import, use, transfer or re-export the Software, except in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations of the relevant government authorities. You understand that the import or export of the Software may be regulated by some governments due to the Software's encryption capabilities. You hereby represent that: (i) to the best of your knowledge you are eligible to receive the Software  under applicable law; (ii) you will not use the Software in the development, production,  handling, maintenance, storage, detection, identification or dissemination of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons or their missile delivery systems, or of materials or equipment that could be used in such weapons or their missile delivery systems, or resell or export to anyone or any entity involved in such activity; and (iii) you will ensure that authorized users use the Software in accordance with the foregoing restrictions. You acknowledge that any export classification in respect of the Software made by QSS shall not be construed as a representation or warranty regarding the proper export classification for the Software or whether an export license or other documentation is required for your exportation of the Software. You accept sole responsibility to ensure that your export, import and use of the Software comply with all applicable laws; \n\n(f) \tuse, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed to by QSS in a written agreement between you and QSS, the Software in any application in which death, serious personal injury, or severe physical, environmental or property damage is a foreseeable consequence of Software use or failure (\"High-Risk Applications\"), including but not limited to in the monitoring, operation or control of nuclear facilities, mass transit systems, aircraft navigation, flight control or communications systems, air traffic control systems, weapon systems, and life-support machines.

PRESERVATION OF RIGHTS.   You agree not to directly or indirectly grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights or immunities under QSS's or its licensors' intellectual property rights in the Software that would subject such intellectual property to an open source license or scheme in which there is or could be interpreted to be a requirement that as a condition of use, modification and/or distribution, the Software be: \n\n(a) \tdisclosed or distributed in Source Code form, \n\n(b) \tlicensed for the purpose of making derivative works, or \n\n(c) \tredistributable at no charge. \n\n\n8.  THIRD PARTY RESTRICTIONS.   Components of the QNX Product Portfolio contain elements of third party software that are licensed to QSS (and are therefore provided to you) for limited purposes and under terms and conditions that differ from those of this License. Such licenses include but are not limited to:\n\n(a)  \tthe Eclipse Public License (\"EPL\"), GNU Public License (\"GPL\"), Lesser GNU Public License (\"LGPL\"), Mozilla Public License (\"MPL\"), and other open source licenses; and/or\n\n(b)  \tthird party licenses that impose restrictions on use, copying, authorized purposes, etc. and/or supplemental obligations including, without limitation, board support packages or individual device drivers that are limited to use with specific hardware manufacturers' products, and components that are provided for a limited time and/or to use solely for demonstration and internal evaluation/trial purposes.\n\nThose third party license terms, and notices that those third party licensors require to be provided, are set out for: \n\n(i) \tCommercially Released Software in the License Supplement and/or the corresponding Notice Files, and \n\n(ii) \tExperimental Software at the applicable download site, in or with the agreement or authorization it was provided under, or in the corresponding Source Code (e.g., see 3rd Party Licensed Code). \n\nYou are solely responsible for ensuring that limited-use software is not used outside of the limits stated. \n\nUpdated License Supplements and Notice Files may be issued for each new version of the Software.

You acknowledge and agree that QSS can disclose to its third party licensors that you have received a copy of their technology.\n\n\n9. OWNERSHIP AND RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.   The Software is protected by intellectual property laws including but not limited to copyright laws, both locally and internationally. The Software is not sold but is licensed to you on the terms and conditions set forth in this License. QSS and its licensors retain all rights, title and interests in and to the Software (including but not limited to any elements of the Software embodied in derivative works you create, and any elements of the Software that are derivative works created by or for QSS or its licensors from or using open source software) and reserve all rights in the Software not expressly licensed by this License, including but not limited to copyrights, patent rights and rights in Confidential Information. Subject to all underlying rights of QSS and its licensors in the Software, and to the terms and conditions of this License, all other rights, title and interests in and to any authorized derivative works of the Software and other software that you may independently develop pursuant to this License will be retained by you. No trademarks or service marks of QSS or its licensors are licensed by this License, and you understand and agree that QSS trademarks or service marks may not be applied to your goods or services without the express written permission of QSS.\n\n\n10.  FEEDBACK.  QSS welcomes suggestions, comments or other feedback about its products and services (e.g., regarding their utility, reliability, or performance) and your user experience with the Software, as well as any bug-fixes, features, functionality or enhancements you would like to see in future versions (\"Feedback\"). You agree that all Feedback is and will be given entirely voluntarily and, even if designated as confidential, will not create any confidentiality obligations for QSS. You represent and warrant that you will not provide any Feedback that you know or have reason to believe might infringe any third party intellectual property rights or misappropriate any third party confidential information or trade secrets. Except as expressly stated above, any Feedback you provide will be considered to be provided \"as is\" without any warranty or condition of any kind, whether express or implied. If you require QSS to enter into an intellectual property license to use any Feedback then, either at the time of providing your Feedback or within ten (10) business days thereafter, you will notify the person to whom you are providing the Feedback and will provide notice to QSS's licensing group at licensing@qnx.com. In the absence of such notification you hereby grant to QSS a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, directly and indirectly sub-licensable, paid up and royalty free right and license to exploit the Feedback in any manner and for any purpose including without limitation to make (or have made), develop (or have developed), modify (or have modified), reproduce (or have reproduced), use (or have used), import or export (or have imported or exported), offer for sale or sell (or have offered for sale or have sold), license (or authorize others to license), and distribute or otherwise dispose of (directly and indirectly) as part of any of QSS's or its Affiliates' business, technology, products or services, and to grant others the right to do any of the foregoing. \n\n\n11.  U.S. GOVERNMENT RIGHTS.   Notwithstanding any agreement with a third party or any provision of law, regulation or policy, if you are an agency of the government of the United States of America, then your rights in respect of the Software shall not exceed the rights provided under this License, unless expressly agreed upon by QSS in a written agreement between you and QSS and signed by a signing officer of QSS.  \n\n\n12.  SUPPORT.   Support from QSS for QNX SDP and certain of the QNX Licensed Products is available at extra cost under the terms and conditions of the applicable Schedule A Support Addendum under a Commercial License or Partner License or pursuant to a separate Priority Support Agreement or other enhanced support engagement with QSS.  Contact an authorized QNX sales representative for more information (http://www.qnx.com/company/contact/). \n\n\n13.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. \n\n13.1 \tIn this License: \n\n\"Confidential Information\" means any information in any form or medium: \n\n(a) \tthat is proprietary or confidential to the disclosing party (\"Discloser\"), its Affiliates, or to their respective customers, suppliers or other business partners, including without limitation information that is embedded in or related to Discloser's products or services, or to the development, testing or commercial exploitation thereof; \n\n(b) \tthat is either specifically identified as confidential prior to or at the time of its disclosure, or would generally be considered confidential in the embedded software industry; and\n\n(c) \tthat is directly or indirectly disclosed to the receiving party (\"Recipient\") by or on behalf of Discloser, or to which Recipient is otherwise provided access by Discloser or on Discloser's behalf. \n\n       QSS Confidential Information includes without limitation: \n\n(i) \tSoftware Source Code; \n\n(ii) \tExperimental Software, in any form, that has been made available to you through the QNX Software Center or any other developer portal hosted by QSS; \n\n(iii) \tmyQNX.com and QNX Software Center user account information, access ID's and passwords; \n\n(iv) \tDevelopment License Certificates and License Keys; and \n\n(v) \tany benchmarking information for Experimental Software generated by or for you. \n\n\"Trade Secret(s)\" means Confidential Information that is proprietary technology information (including but not limited to Source Code, algorithms, formulae, methods and processes), the disclosure of which to unauthorized third parties could cause Discloser to suffer a significant loss of competitive and/or commercial advantage in its markets.\n\n13.2\tDISCLOSURE, USE AND REPRODUCTION.   Except as specifically provided herein, Recipient will hold all Confidential Information in confidence in accordance with the terms of this License. Recipient shall use and reproduce Confidential Information only to the extent reasonably required to fulfill the purpose of this License. Recipient may provide access to Confidential Information to, and authorizes the use and reproduction of Confidential Information by, Recipient's employees, Recipient's Affiliates for use by their employees, and Recipient's Contractors or Recipient's Affiliates' Contractors for use by their employees, but in each case only as reasonably required to fulfill the purpose of this License, and provided that: \n\n(a) \tall such persons have a need to know the Confidential Information and have entered into confidentiality agreements with terms and conditions that afford no less protection to the Confidential Information than the terms and conditions of this License; and \n\n(b) \tall acts or omissions of such persons will be deemed to be Recipient's acts or omissions. \n\nRecipient will always remain responsible to Discloser for the full performance of the terms and conditions of this Section 13 (Confidential Information) by all persons to whom Recipient directly or indirectly discloses Discloser's Confidential Information.\n\n13.3 \tOTHER DISCLOSURES.   In addition to the disclosure rights in Section 13.2 (Disclosure, Use and Reproduction), Recipient may disclose Confidential Information if and only to the extent: \n\n(a) \tit is required to do so by law, provided Recipient, to the extent of its legal right to do so, gives Discloser sufficient notice to enable it to seek an order limiting or precluding such disclosure, or \n\n(b) \tan authorized signatory of Discloser provides Discloser's explicit prior written authorization.\n\n13.4 \tSTANDARD OF CARE.   Recipient shall use a reasonable degree of care to prevent the unauthorized use, reproduction or disclosure of Confidential Information, which care shall not be less than the degree of care that Recipient uses to protect its own Confidential Information of a similar nature. \n\n13.5\tSECURITY FOR SOURCE CODE.   You must store any copies of Software Source Code on computers and/or networks that are secured by controls employed by you for materials reasonably considered to be Trade Secrets or otherwise highly confidential.\n\n13.6\tEXCLUSIONS.   Information that Recipient can establish: \n\n(a) \tis presently known or becomes known to Recipient or its authorized disclosees from an independent source without obligations of confidence, \n       \n(b) \tis in or enters the public domain after the date of initial disclosure to Recipient through no fault or act of Recipient or its Affiliates, or their Contractors, \n       \n(c) \twas independently developed by or on behalf of Recipient or its authorized disclosees, or \n       \n(d) \tis Feedback provided pursuant to Section 10 (Feedback), \n\nshall not be considered Confidential Information under this License. \n\n13.7\tCONFIDENTIALITY PERIOD.   Recipient's duties with respect to Confidential Information under this License will expire five (5) years after the end of this License (except for Trade Secrets, which shall remain subject to the terms of this License for so long as they constitute Trade Secrets). \n\n13.8\tRETURN OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.   Upon termination of this License, and upon Discloser's written request, Recipient shall promptly return all Confidential Information received from Discloser (including without limitation all copies thereof and any summaries of orally disclosed information in Recipient's or its authorized disclosees' possession or control) or will certify through an authorized signatory of Recipient that all such Confidential Information has been destroyed. Failure of the Discloser to make such request shall not entitle Recipient to make any further use of Confidential Information, or otherwise extend Recipient's rights after termination of this License, and Recipient specifically agrees to cease any further use of Discloser's Confidential Information. Any electronic copies made as part of Recipient's standard backup and archival practices shall be excluded from the obligations of this Section 13.8 (Return of Confidential Information); however, this License shall continue to apply to such Confidential Information, including but not limited to any restored copies thereof. The provisions of this Section 13 (Confidential Information) shall survive termination of this License for any reason. Recipient may retain one copy of Discloser's Confidential Information in the confidential, restricted access files of its legal department for use only to prove compliance with the terms of this License.\n\n13.9 \tREMEDIES.   Recipient acknowledges and agrees that: \n\n(a) \tthe Confidential Information has been developed at significant cost and has important commercial value to Discloser, its Affiliates or to their respective customers, suppliers or other business partners; \n       \n(b) \tknowledge of all or any part of the Confidential Information may constitute insider information under securities laws or yield a competitive advantage over others not having such knowledge; and \n       \n(c) \tdisclosure or inappropriate use of Confidential Information could cause Discloser irreparable harm and that therefore Discloser will have the right to seek, in addition to any of its other rights and remedies, injunctive relief for any violation of this License without posting bond, or by posting bond at the lowest amount required by law.\n\n13.10\tRESIDUALS.  Nothing in this License will be interpreted as precluding any representative of either of the parties or its Affiliates from making use of his/her general knowledge and skills in connection with other projects being performed on behalf of themselves or his/her employer, even if such general knowledge and skills have been furthered by his/her having access to the Confidential Information exchanged under this License. The confidentiality obligations of this License will not apply to Residual Information, where \"Residual Information\" means general technical, non-public knowledge, experience, know-how or information in a non-tangible form that is retained in the unaided memories of representatives, to whom Confidential Information is disclosed under this License, where such individuals are not consciously aware that the information forms part of the Confidential Information. A representative's memory will be considered to be unaided if they have not intentionally memorized Confidential Information for the purpose of retaining and subsequently using or disclosing it. The parties each acknowledge and agree that this Residual Information exception is intended only to alleviate the possibility of inadvertent breach of the obligations of this Section 13 (Confidential Information).\n\n\n14. LIMITED WARRANTIES AND INDEMNITY.\n\n14.1\tBACKGROUND.   While QSS is committed to providing a versatile and reliable product, it does not warrant that the Software will function in accordance with its Documentation in every combination of hardware platform, software environment and software configuration. You acknowledge that errors are likely to be encountered when the Software is used in your particular application. You therefore accept responsibility for satisfying yourself that the Software is suitable for your intended use. This includes conducting rigorous testing of the Software, in combination with your derivative works and value-added software application(s), on your target hardware platform. It also includes thorough hazard and risk analysis and risk mitigation at the system level to determine whether faults could impact the functional safety of your Target System, or Partner Product, in the case of a Partner, in which the Software may be used. The system design, system validation and the decision to release a Target System, or a Partner Product, in the case of a Partner, are all matters solely within your control. These are decisions that can fundamentally impact the functional safety of the system being deployed, over its entire life cycle. QSS offers Support under a Commercial License or Partner License, as well as custom support plans and custom engineering services, under separate agreements, to help developers identify and solve particular Software implementation and integration issues.\n\n14.2\tEXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE.   QSS makes Experimental Software available to you primarily through the QNX Software Center or any other developer portal hosted by QSS.\nSuch QSS developer portals may post experimental, alpha and beta builds for components that may be included in upcoming commercial releases. Experimental Software from QSS may include, but not limited to, unsupported BSPs, drivers and sample Source Code, as well as trial tool and runtime components. \n\nYou acknowledge that you must always review any available Source Code, corresponding Documentation (including but not limited to new License Supplements, Notice Files and release notes) and developer portal notices to confirm the release status and any supplementary terms and conditions or other third party licensing considerations relating to such Experimental Software downloads (see Section 8 (Third Party Restrictions)).  \n\nQSS offers access to experimental, alpha and beta builds in order to give the QNX developer community the earliest possible access to the latest QNX Product Portfolio technology and bug-fixes. Other Experimental Software is offered as a means of accelerating your development by leveraging additional source or binary code.   The form and nature of Experimental Software may change without prior notice to you and future versions of Experimental Software may be incompatible with developments on previous versions.  \n\nYou acknowledge that QSS may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing Experimental Software (or any features within the Experimental Software) to you at QSS's sole discretion, without prior notice.  You should also be aware that significant changes, such as changes to or elimination of functionality or APIs, may be made to subsequent releases. \n\nMany developers will migrate during their development cycle from QSS's Experimental Software to corresponding Commercially Released Software as it becomes available. Others may decide to ship Experimental Software after thoroughly testing the stability of such code and/or assessing the maturity of any milestone builds.  \n\nEXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE MAY HAVE KNOWN DEFICIENCIES, MAY NOT HAVE BEEN FULLY OPTIMIZED AND TESTED, MAY NOT BE FULLY SUPPORTED BY QSS AND MAY BE UNRELIABLE. EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE IS MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU STRICTLY ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND. IN NO EVENT WILL QSS AND/OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE UNDER ANY CAUSE OF ACTION WHATSOEVER FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE ANY EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE. \n\n14.3\tLIMITED WARRANTY OF PERFORMANCE.   Under a Commercial License or Partner License, QSS warrants to you for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of the initial installation of the Commercially Released Software licensed to you under this License and identified as Type I Software and qualified for \"Full\" support in the applicable \"Support Provided\" column in the related Notice File, will be free of Errors. An \"Error\" means when the Software, when used in accordance with the associated Documentation and on a supported reference platform fails to materially behave the way the Documentation says it should. Software will be presumed to be free of Errors unless the error or problem can be reproduced on a reference platform and the error or problem does not result from modifications to, or incorrect or improper use of, the Software. \n\n14.4\tREMEDY FOR BREACH OF LIMITED WARRANTY OF PERFORMANCE.   Your sole remedy and QSS's sole obligation for any breach of the warranty of Section 14.3 (Limited Warranty of Performance) will be, at QSS's option, either to: \n\n(a) \tprovide you with a free explanation, workaround or Update that allows the Software to be used free of Errors; or \n\n(b) \tterminate this License pursuant to Section 17 (Term, Subscription Renewal & Termination) and, upon confirmation that you have complied with your obligations under this License, to provide you with a refund of any license fees that you paid to QSS or its authorized distributor pursuant to this License.\n\n14.5\tINDEMNITY AND EXCLUSIONS.   Under a Commercial License or Partner License,  and subject to the limitations of Section 15 (Limitation of Liability), if a claim is brought against you during the term hereof for Damages caused by the infringement of any third party copyrights or patents, or the misappropriation of trade secrets, arising out of your use, and, where applicable, development, distribution or sale of Commercially Released Software under the terms and conditions of this License (any one or more, \"Infringement Claims\") then QSS agrees to defend you against such Infringement Claims, and to indemnify and hold you harmless from resulting Damages and reasonable costs and expenses incurred (including but not limited to reasonable lawyers' fees and disbursements), provided that you: \n\n(a) \tpromptly notify QSS in writing of such Infringement Claims, \n\n(b) \tprovide QSS with sole control of the defense and/or settlement thereof, \n\n(c) \tfurnish to QSS on request all relevant information in your possession or control for such defense, \n\n(d) \tcooperate with and provide such assistance, in the defense of such Infringement Claims, as reasonably requested by QSS, and \n\n(e) \tdo not admit any such Infringement Claims and/or make any payments with respect to any such Infringement Claims without QSS's prior written consent. \n\nExpressly excluded from this indemnity are any assertions of: \n\n(i) \tcopyright infringement or trade secret misappropriation based upon the use, reproduction, performance or distribution of any components of: (1) Experimental Software, (2) Software identified in the License Supplement, Notice Files, or otherwise by QSS in the course of making the Software available to you, as Type III, or (3) Software that have been modified, supplemented or combined with other software, hardware or systems, where the Software on its own would not infringe; \n\n(ii) \tinfringement resulting from QSS's compliance with specifications and/or instructions from you relating to the Software; \n\n(iii)\tinfringement resulting from your failure to make timely use of Updates made available by QSS;  \n\n(iv) infringement resulting from the use of the Software other than in accordance with the applicable Documentation or outside the scope of the license granted under this License; and\n\n(v)\tpatent infringement based upon the making, using, importing or selling of any components of: \n\n(1) \tExperimental Software, \n\n(2) \tSoftware that have been identified in the License Supplement, Notice Files, or otherwise by QSS in the course of making the Software available to you, as Type II or Type III, \n\n(3) \tSoftware that have been identified in the License Supplement, Notice Files, or otherwise by QSS in the course of making the Software available to you, as requiring additional patent rights not included in this License, \n\n(4) \tSoftware that have been modified, supplemented, or combined with other software, hardware or systems, and such Claims arise from the modified, supplemented or combined product, or \n\n(5) \tSoftware that infringe any Essential Patent. \n\nIn this Section 14.5 (Indemnity and Exclusions) \"Essential Patent\" means any patent or patent application which is necessarily infringed in order to use, make, sell, export, import or otherwise distribute a product, apparatus, software or other item that complies with either a mandatory or optional provision of a Standard, which patent or patent application would not have been infringed but for the compliance with such Standard. In addition, for the purpose of this Section 14.5 (Indemnity and Exclusions), a patent or patent application is also necessarily infringed when it is not commercially reasonable to implement a standard without infringing a claim of such patent or patent application because of the lack of a commercially reasonable non-infringing implementation.\n\n14.6\tREMEDIES FOR INDEMNIFIED CLAIMS.   If QSS reasonably believes that one or more of the indemnified acts in Section 14.5 (Indemnity and Exclusions) have occurred or may occur, QSS will, at its sole expense (subject to the limitations of Section 15 (Limitation of Liability)), and option: \n\n(a) \tprocure for you the right to continue using the infringing Software; \n       \n(b) \treplace the infringing Software with non-infringing software of comparable function; \n       \n(c) \tmodify the infringing Software to be non-infringing; or \n\t\n(d) \tif none of the foregoing alternatives is available to QSS on commercially reasonable terms, terminate your right to the Software, but only to the extent necessary to avoid or mitigate Damages. You will have the right to terminate all of your rights if you determine, in your commercially reasonable judgment, that such partial termination renders your remaining rights ineffective. Subject to the limitations of Section 15 (Limitation of Liability), upon such full or partial termination, QSS will refund to you, pro-rata to the extent of such termination, the license fees paid by you pursuant to this License, if any, that are associated with the terminated rights. \n\nSECTION 14.5 (INDEMNITY AND EXCLUSIONS) AND THIS SECTION 14.6 (REMEDIES FOR INDEMNIFIED CLAIMS) STATE YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES FOR INFRINGEMENT AND/OR MISAPPROPRIATION BY THE SOFTWARE.\n\n14.7  \tNO OTHER WARRANTIES. \n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 14 (LIMITED WARRANTIES AND INDEMNITY), AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SOFTWARE LICENSED AND ANY SERVICES OR HARDWARE PROVIDED UNDER THIS QNX DEVELOPMENT LICENSE AGREEMENT ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND TITLE. SUBJECT TO THE LIMITED WARRANTY IN SECTION 14.3 (LIMITED WARRANTY OF PERFORMANCE), QSS DOES NOT WARRANT AND NOTHING IN THIS LICENSE IMPLIES ANY WARRANTY THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE AND/OR HARDWARE, OR ACCESS TO SERVICES, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, OR THAT ANY ERRORS FOUND WILL BE CORRECTED.\n\n14.8\tSURVIVAL.   This Section 14 (Limited Warranties and Indemnity) will survive the termination of this License for any reason and will apply notwithstanding the failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy.\n\n\n15.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  \n\nTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL QSS AND/OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, ECONOMIC, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST REVENUE, PROFITS OR EARNINGS, LOST OR DAMAGED DATA OR BREACHES OF DATA SECURITY, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, FAILURE TO REALIZE EXPECTED SAVINGS, OR OTHER COMMERCIAL OR ECONOMIC LOSS, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, HARDWARE AND/OR SERVICES (INCLUDING ANY THIRD PARTY ITEMS OR GOODS, SOFTWARE, SERVICES OR CONTENT FURNISHED TO QSS BY YOU), EVEN IF QSS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE OR CLAIM AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DAMAGES COULD REASONABLY BE FORESEEN. \n\nTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF QSS AND/OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY AND ALL COSTS, LOSSES AND DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ATTORNEYS' FEES INCURRED PURSUANT TO SECTION 14.5 (INDEMNITY AND EXCLUSIONS) AND SECTION 14.6 (REMEDIES FOR INDEMNIFIED CLAIMS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE TOTAL FEES YOU HAVE PAID TO QSS PURSUANT TO THIS LICENSE FOR USE OF THE SOFTWARE AND ANY HARDWARE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM OR ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100.00). THIS SECTION 15 (LIMITATION OF LIABILITY) WILL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THIS LICENSE FOR ANY REASON AND WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.\n\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE CONSTITUTE AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THIS LICENSE IN THE ABSENCE OF WHICH: (A) THE FEES AND OTHER TERMS IN THIS LICENSE WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT; AND (B) QSS'S ABILITY TO OFFER AND YOUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN THE SOFTWARE OR ANY PORTION THEREOF UNDER THIS LICENSE WOULD BE IMPAIRED.\n\n\n16. THIRD PARTY LICENSES.   Certain Runtime Components may enable Target Systems and/or Partner Products to produce or reproduce (including but not limited to by ripping), copy, perform and/or display multimedia content (e.g., audio, images, video). The required intellectual property license rights necessary to use or offer devices with such capabilities will vary, depending on factors such as the intended use of the device, the types of content involved, the markets in which the device is used or sold, etc. You are solely responsible for determining all such requirements and making all of the arrangements (e.g., obtaining licenses, paying copyright collectives' fees, limiting the device functionality in some markets, etc.) necessary to make, use, import, distribute and/or sell your Target Systems and/or Partner Product, and/or to offer related services (to the extent permitted by the terms and conditions of this License), in all of your direct or indirect markets. The provisions of Section 14.5 (Indemnity and Exclusions) do not extend to infringement caused by producing, reproducing, copying, performing or displaying any multimedia content. Further, you agree to indemnify and hold QSS and/or its Representatives harmless from all Damages, and any reasonable costs and expenses incurred (including but not limited to reasonable lawyers' fees and disbursements) and Damages relating to any third-party action against QSS and/or its Representatives based on intellectual property infringement caused by making, using, importing, distributing and/or selling Target Systems and/or Partner Products, and/or offering related services, in any of your direct or indirect markets (\"Claims\"), other than Claims based solely on infringement claims for which QSS remains responsible under Section 14.5 (Indemnity and Exclusions), where applicable. \n\n\n17.  TERM, SUBSCRIPTION RENEWAL & TERMINATION. \n\n17.1 \tTERM, SUBSCRIPTION RENEWAL.   The term of this License for paid-up Software licenses will continue until terminated in accordance with this Section 17 (Term, Subscription Renewal & Termination).

You can renew Software and Standard Support subscriptions by issuing corresponding purchase orders to QSS at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiry date (see your Development License Certificate(s) for Software and Project License subscriptions, and Section A-1-6 (Standard Support Subscription Term) of Schedule A (Standard Support Addendum) for Standard Support subscriptions).\n\n17.2 \tTERMINATION.   This License will terminate immediately for subscription-based licenses or services upon the expiration of your License Key or expiration of your subscription as defined in your Development License Certificate, or your failure to pay any optional renewal fees when due. Either party may terminate this License upon fifteen (15) days' prior notice to the other party of a breach of a material term of this License if the breach has not been cured within the notice period, with the exception of payment or breach of confidentiality provisions, in which case termination will be immediate.

Any Software or Standard Support subscription fees, or pre-payment of Software royalties or license fees are non-refundable. If either party terminates this License for any reason, all of your license rights, and those of your Affiliates, any Contractors and your distributors, will immediately cease upon termination.

Any attempted assignment or grant in contravention to this Section 18 (Patent Non-assert) shall be null and void.\n\n\n19.  GOVERNING LAW.   This License will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws in force in the Province of Ontario, Canada, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.

ASSIGNMENT.   Subject to the export restrictions in Section 6(e) and terms and conditions set forth in any applicable License Supplement, you may, with QSS's prior written consent, assign a paid up Commercial License to a third party provided you first: \n\n(a) \tprovide QSS with written acknowledgement of the assignee's acceptance of the terms and conditions of this License, \n\n(b) \ttransfer the corresponding License Keys and Development License Certificates to the assignee; and \n\n(c) \tcomply with the requirements of Section 13.8 (Return of Confidential Information). \n\nYou may not separately assign or transfer License Keys or Development License Certificates, except as provided in Section 5.1 (Deployment of Software). Any other attempted assignment or delegation in violation of the foregoing will be void and of no effect. This License will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. \n\n\n21.  EXECUTION AND ACCEPTANCE.   Nothing but this License (or any other written agreement between you and QSS) authorizes you to undertake any of the activities described in this License, and doing so in contravention of these terms and conditions constitutes breach of contract, and/or copyright or patent infringement. When you enter your License Key or Floating License Key to unlock the Software this License will be displayed for your review and acceptance. Choosing \"I ACCEPT\" during that process constitutes your execution and acceptance of this License, and the first date of such acceptance is the \"Effective Date\" for the purpose of this License.  \n\n\n22.  ENTIRE AGREEMENT/MODIFICATIONS.   This License, together with the License Supplement(s) and Notice Files, any Invoice accompanying the Software, and the corresponding Development License Certificate(s) constitutes the entire agreement between the parties pertaining to this subject matter and cancels and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreement, discussion, correspondence, statement, representation, negotiation, understanding, undertaking or agreement dealing with the same subject matter. The provisions of this License will prevail in the event of a conflict between any of its terms and conditions and the provisions of the License Supplement(s), Notice Files, or Development License Certificate(s), or any inconsistent or additional terms or conditions of any related purchase orders or invoices whenever issued or received. No amendment, modification or waiver of any part of this License will be binding unless in a written document that expressly refers to this License and that is signed by authorized signatories of both parties. \n\n\n23.  INTERPRETATION.   The divisions and headings in this License have been included for convenience only and will not affect its construction or interpretation. Any provision of this License that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.\n\n\n24.
